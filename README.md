# dynamiccurbs
This project's goal is to develop a city-scale dynamic curb use simulation tool and an open-source curb management platform that address these unmet needs. Simulation and management capabilities will include dynamically and concurrently controlling price, number of spaces, allowed parking duration, time of sale or reservation, and curb space use type (e.g., dynamic curb space rezoning based on supply and demand).
We will deliver a city-scale dynamic curb use simulation tool and an open-source curb management platform. Simulation and management capabilities will include dynamically and concurrently controlling price, number of spaces, allowed parking duration, time of sale or reservation, and curb space use type (e.g., dynamic curb space rezoning based on supply and demand).
Curb management professionals will be able to simulate different curb use policies and incentives to determine how flexible and dynamic the curb can be in response to zoning, pricing, timing, availability, or other controls, to reduce congestion and improve energy efficiency. In addition, municipal partners will be able to use the curb space communications and control tool as an open-source prototype for deploying such a system. Transportation engineers will be able to incorporate simulation results into fundamental diagram parameterization that is sensitive to curb configuration; while these diagrams also form a core component to curb enhancements in the BEAM city-scale simulator. Lastly, industry partners will be able to use the communications and data pipelining utility to improve situational awareness at the curb, resulting less unnecessary congestion at the point of pick-up and drop-off
